###Geolocation assignment for Algonquin College Program Winter Semester 2015
This project is to practice the use of google static maps based on the users location.
I have also added the option at the bottom to enter in different locations so the user may update the map in case of location error.

###Use of the site
1. First you must allow your browser to use location services. This is typically a pop-up or a drop down near the top of the browser window.
2. Now you map will appear in the site based on the location your computer found you at.
3. If you wish to update the map location type it in the input at the bottom of the map and click the button.
